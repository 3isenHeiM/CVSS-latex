# CVSS-latex

This aims to become a LaTeX package allowing anyone to use and nicely print the CVSS ratings for a given CVSS string.


## To-do

- [x] Fix the expansion error preventing nested commands like `\category{\computeCVSS{AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N}}`
- [ ] Add support for CVSS complete string
- [ ] Add CVSS values as variables (future CVSS version)
- [ ] Add support for full CVSS vector (temporal and environmental score)
- [ ] Turn this into a latex package
